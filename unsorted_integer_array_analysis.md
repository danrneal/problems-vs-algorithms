# Unsorted Integer Array

## Design Choices

This algorithm uses a linear search algorithm to find the minimum and maximum elements of an unsorted array.

## Time Complexity

The unsorted array is traversed only once making the time complexity of this algorithm O(n).

## Space Complexity

The minimum and maximum values are stored in a couple of variables and no other data structures are created or altered meaning the space complexity is O(1).
